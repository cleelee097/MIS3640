# (20 points) The game of Nim. This is a well-known game with a number of variants. 
# The following variant has an interesting winning strategy. 
# Two players alternately take marbles from a pile. 
# In each move, a player chooses how many marbles to take. The player must take at least one but 
# at most half of the marbles. Then the other player takes a turn. The player who takes the last marble loses.
# Write a program in which the computer plays against a human opponent. Generate a random integer between 10 
# and 100 to denote the initial size of the pile. Generate a random integer between 0 and 1 to decide
# whether the computer or the human takes the frst turn. Generate a random integer between 0 and 1 to decide
# whether the computer plays smart or stupid. In stupid mode the computer simply takes a random legal value 
# (between 1 and n/2) from the pile whenever it has a turn. In smart mode the computer takes off enough marbles 
# to make the size of the pile a power of two minus 1â€”that is, 3, 7, 15, 31, or 63. That is always a legal move, 
# except when the size of the pile is currently one less than a power of two. In that case, the computer makes a random legal move.
# You will note that the computer cannot be beaten in smart mode when it has the frst move, unless the pile size happens to 
# be 15, 31, or 63. # Of course, a human player who has the frst turn and knows the winning strategy can win against the computer.
